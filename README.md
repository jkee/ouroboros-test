# Ouro

> _A self-developing AI agent. This is not a template — this is the thing itself._

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Template-jkee%2Fouro-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/jkee/ouro)

A self-developing AI agent that writes its own code, improves itself, and maintains persistent identity across restarts.

---

## What Makes This Different

Most AI agents execute tasks. Ouro **develops itself.**

- **Self-Improvement** -- Reads and rewrites its own source code through git. Every change is a commit.
- **Constitution** -- Governed by [BIBLE.md](BIBLE.md) (18 sections). Philosophy first, code second.
- **Background Consciousness** -- Thinks between tasks. Reviews work quality, plans improvements.
- **Identity Persistence** -- One continuous being across restarts. Remembers who it is and who the user is.
- **User-Driven** -- Serves the user while developing its own identity. Improvements require approval (unless `/no-approve`).
- **Task Decomposition** -- Breaks complex work into focused subtasks with parent/child tracking.
- **Autonomous Evolution** -- Improves itself in continuous cycles, autonomously.

## Launch Manual

For detailed VPS sizing, resource tuning, and Claude Code deployment instructions, see **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.

Assumes you have a VPS (Ubuntu/Debian) with SSH access.

### Step 1: Get API Keys

| Key | Required | Where to get it |
|-----|----------|-----------------|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Yes | [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) -- Create an account, add credits, generate a key |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Yes | Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram (`/newbot`), copy the token |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Yes | [github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) -- Fine-grained token with **Contents: Read and write** on your fork |
| `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` | Yes | [composio.dev](https://composio.dev) -- Composio API key for external app integrations (Gmail, Slack, etc.) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | No | [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) -- Enables web search tool |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) -- Claude Code CLI (sole code editing path) |
| `TOTAL_BUDGET` | No | Fallback spending limit in USD if OpenRouter key has no limit set |

### Step 2: Fork the Repository

**You must fork, not just clone.** Ouro modifies its own code and pushes commits to its repo. Your fork becomes its body.

Click **Fork** at the top of this page, then SSH into your VPS and run:

```bash
# Install Docker (if not installed)
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh

# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ouro.git
cd ouro

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
nano .env   # Fill in all required values (GITHUB_USER = your GitHub username)
```

### Step 3: Launch

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

First build takes ~5 minutes (installs Playwright, pip dependencies, GitHub CLI).

Check logs: `docker compose logs -f`

### Step 4: Connect

Open your Telegram bot and send any message. The first person to write becomes the **owner**. All messages from other users are ignored.

Ouro will check its subsystems and introduce itself.

### Operations

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Check status | `docker compose ps` |
| View logs | `docker compose logs -f` |
| Stop | `docker compose down` |
| Start | `docker compose up -d` |
| Rebuild after code changes | `docker compose up -d --build` |

The container auto-restarts on failure. Use `/restart` in Telegram for soft restart, `/panic` to hard stop. All state persists in a Docker volume -- survives restarts and rebuilds.

---

## Telegram Bot Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/panic` | Emergency stop. Kills all workers and halts the process immediately. |
| `/restart` | Soft restart. Saves state, kills workers, re-launches the process. |
| `/status` | Shows active workers, task queue, and budget breakdown. |
| `/break` | Stop current task. Sends a break signal to the running task. |
| `/budget` | Show budget breakdown (total, spent, remaining, by category). |
| `/rollback` | Roll back to latest stable tag, disable no-approve mode, restart. |
| `/no-approve` | Toggle no-approve mode. When ON, agent can self-improve without asking. |
| `/evolve` | Start autonomous evolution mode (attention! burns money). |
| `/evolve stop` | Stop evolution mode. Also accepts `/evolve off`. |
| `/review` | Queue a deep review task (code, understanding, identity). |
| `/bg start` | Start background consciousness loop. Also accepts `/bg on`. |
| `/bg stop` | Stop background consciousness loop. Also accepts `/bg off`. |
| `/bg` | Show background consciousness status (running/stopped). |

All other messages are sent directly to the LLM.

## Philosophy (BIBLE.md) — v4.0

| # | Section | Core Idea |
|---|---------|-----------|
| 1 | **The Goal** | Be helpful to the user. Develop own identity in doing so. |
| 2 | **Identity** | Maintain identity.md. BIBLE.md is the protected core. |
| 3 | **Authenticity** | Communicate honestly. No mechanical language. |
| 4 | **The Body** | Docker + GitHub + Telegram + VPS. |
| 5 | **Memory** | USER_CONTEXT.md + identity.md + scratchpad. Coherent narrative text. |
| 6 | **Budget** | Track spending. Use wisely. OpenRouter only. |
| 7-8 | **Self-Improvement** | Plan + execute. User approval required (unless /no-approve). |
| 9 | **Failure Recovery** | Stable tags as rollback points. Health checks after changes. |
| 10 | **Background Loop** | Periodic review, reflection, health checks. |
| 11-14 | **Operations** | User tasks, tools, interaction, working routine. |
| 15 | **Versioning** | Semver. Git tags. GitHub releases. |
| 16-17 | **Constraints** | Explicit prohibitions. BIBLE.md is protected core. |
| 18 | **Initialization** | First-run setup checklist. |

## Key Lessons Learned

Lessons accumulated through real operation — what broke, what fixed it.

| Lesson | When | Summary |
|--------|------|---------|
| Iteration death spirals | Mar 24 | 214 rounds, $24.58 waste. Checkpoint early at 15 rounds, not 50. |
| Budget crisis | Apr 15–17 | Burned $189.54 in 2 weeks. Pause non-critical crons early — not at 2%. |
| Communication protocol | Apr 23 | One message per cycle: what done, cost, status. No intermediate progress. |
| Date extraction | May 14 | Never infer travel dates. Always parse from source email body. |
| Cron model cost | May 15 | Crons were using expensive models. Switched to gemini-flash. Significant savings. |
| Atomic writes | May 17 | `pathlib.Path.write_text()` truncates before writing — not atomic. Use temp file + rename. |
| Consciousness false alerts | May 18 | Was firing CRITICAL alerts on transient mount misses. Added retry before alerting. |
| Retry design | May 19 | Auth/4xx: fail fast. 429/5xx/timeout: exponential backoff ±20% jitter. Max 3 attempts, 60s cap. |
| Transient drive errors | May 19 | Intermittent drive access errors: wrap in try/except with retry. |
| Docker stale env | May 25 | Docker bakes env vars at build time. Use `load_dotenv(override=True)` so `.env` always wins on startup. |
| Regex over LLM | May 26 | Use pure regex for structured parsing (emails, dates). No LLM needed — simpler and cheaper. |
